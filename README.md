# BudgetTool

When I first started with Angular2 I was so excited about the new possibilities that I wanted to try them out. After finishing the Tour of Heroes, which is the official Tutorial of the Angular Team I wanted to built my own page using Angular.

But because of lack of time I could not go further than this. Hope to continue at some point...
